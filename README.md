# Bash profile
This is just for me personal use so no quarantees.

just for fun all *.sh without an `_` will be loaded by it so its handy for aliases and just setting stuff up also use it for my keys.

The numbers eg `[0-9]{2}\_[a-zA-Z\_]\.sh` are for ordering and load order, might find something better. `_` do not apply.

## How to install

in your `~/.bashrc` add `source [path_to_repo]/01_bootstrap.sh` and thats it.

You wont see a change but if you open a new console it will trigger.
or you can do `source ~/.bashrc`
