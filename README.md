# Bash profile
This is just for me personal use so no quarantees.

just for fun all *.sh without an `_` will be loaded by it so its handy for aliases and just setting stuff up also use it for my keys.

## How to install

in your `~/.bashrc` add `source [path_to_repo]/bootstrap.sh` and thats it.

You wont see a change but if you open a new console it will trigger.
or you can do `source ~/.bashrc`
